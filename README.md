# Guardian API Demo

A demo project using the Guardian API.

**This project uses:**

-   [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
-   [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs)
-   [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/)

## NPM Tasks

The following tasks are available:

```bash

npm run dev
# Run the development server

npm run build
# Run the production build
```

## Requirements

-   **Node:** > v18.11.0

## Considerations

The API key should probably be locked down! Not sure how to do this, so I've
omitted it from the REPO and deployed version.
